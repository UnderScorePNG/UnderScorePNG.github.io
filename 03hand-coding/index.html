        <h1>What are Lagomorphs?</h1>
        <p>The lagomorphs (/ˈlæɡəmɔːrf/) are the members of the taxonomic order Lagomorpha, of which there are two living families: the Leporidae (rabbits and hares) and the Ochotonidae (pikas). There are 110 recent species of lagomorph of which 109 are extant, including 10 genera of rabbits (42 species), 1 genus of hare (33 species) and 1 genus of pika (34 species). The name of the order is derived from the Ancient Greek lagos (λαγώς, "hare") + morphē (μορφή, "form").</p>
        <p>The evolutionary history of the lagomorphs is still not well understood. Until recently, it was generally agreed that Eurymylus, which lived in eastern Asia and dates back to the late Paleocene or early Eocene, was an ancestor of the lagomorphs. More recent examination of the fossil evidence suggests that the lagomorphs may have instead descended from Anagaloidea, also known as "mimotonids", while Eurymylus was more closely related to rodents (although not a direct ancestor). The leporids first appeared in the late Eocene and rapidly spread throughout the Northern Hemisphere; they show a trend towards increasingly long hind limbs as the modern leaping gait developed. The pikas appeared somewhat later in the Oligocene of eastern Asia.</p>
        <h2>Characteristics of Lagomorphs</h2>
        <p>Lagomorphs are similar to other mammals in that they all have hair, four limbs (i.e., they are tetrapods), and mammary glands and are endotherms. Lagomorphs possess a moderately fused postorbital process to the cranium, unlike other small mammals. They differ in that they have a mixture of "basal" and "derived" physical traits.</p>
        <p>Lagomorphs and rodents form the clade or grandorder Glires. Despite the evolutionary relationship between lagomorphs and rodents, the two orders have some major differences.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lagomorphs have four incisors in the upper jaw (smaller peg teeth behind larger incisors), whereas rodents only have two.</li>
            <li>They are similar to rodents in that their incisors grow continuously, thus necessitating constant chewing on fibrous food to prevent the teeth from growing too long.</li>
            <li>In addition, all lagomorph teeth grow continuously, while for most rodents, only the incisors grow continuously.</li>
            <li>Lagomorph & rodent incisors are structured differently.</li>
            <li>Lagomorphs have more cheek teeth than rodents. Both have a large diastema.</li>
            <li>Lagomorphs are almost strictly herbivorous, unlike rodents, many of which will eat both meat and vegetable matter.</li>
            <li>Lagomorphs have no paw pads; instead, the bottoms of their paws are entirely covered with fur.</li>
            <li>Similar to the rodents, bats, and some mammalian insectivores, they have a smooth-surfaced cerebrum.</li>
            <li>Lagomorphs are unusual among terrestrial mammals in that the females are larger than males.</li>
        </ul>
